    <h3 class="text-neutral-11">How do we use cookies?</h3>
    <p>The Site uses a range of first and third party cookies that enable us to offer an enhanced, personalized experience. The information stored in cookies falls into the following categories:</p>
    <h4 class="h6 text-neutral-11">Strictly Necessary Cookies</h4>
    <p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the Site and its features. Without these cookies, we are unable to provide services that you have asked for, such as purchasing F1 Experiences ticket package and travel packages. </p>
    <h4 class="h6 text-neutral-11">Performance Cookies</h4>
    <p>These cookies collect information about how visitors use the Site, for instance which pages visitors go to most often and if they get error messages. All information that these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous, and is only used to improve how the Site works. </p>
    <h4 class="h6 text-neutral-11">Functionality Cookies</h4>
    <p>These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as your user name and preferred settings).

The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. </p>
    <h4 class="h6 text-neutral-11">Targeting or Advertising Cookies</h4>
    <p>These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests, to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and to help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns.

They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. </p>
