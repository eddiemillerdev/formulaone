If you receive promotional messages from us and would like to opt out, you may do so by following instructions within those messages.  You may have to adjust your preferences separately for each entity within Quint or one of its business partners who may send you promotional messages (for example, if you receive messages from both Quint and one of its business partners).

This personal data may include contact information, commercial information, device data, online activity information, location data, demographic data, and interests and preferences.   These kinds of sharing activities may be considered “sales” under certain laws. They also may be considered sharing or processing of personal data for targeted advertising under applicable law.</p>
    <p>Depending on where you reside, you may have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal data or sharing or processing of your personal data for targeted advertising.  You can exercise your opt-out rights by emailing <a href="mailto: privacy@quint.co">privacy@quint.co</a>.</p>

    <p>To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal data or complying with your deletion or correction request.

    <p>You may designate an authorized agent to submit an access, correction or deletion request on your behalf.  To submit a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a consumer, please email us at <a href="mailto: privacy@quint.co">privacy@quint.co</a>.</p>

    <p>You can choose not to disclose certain location data by adjusting the settings on your device.  Please note, however, that if you choose not to disclose this data, you may not be able to access or use our location-based Online Services.</p>
    <p>You can choose to limit the data that third-party services (for example, social media platforms) disclose to us using the options the applicable third-party service provides to you (for example, the options a third-party social media platform provides when you connect your social media account with the Online Services).

    <h3 class="text-neutral-11">6. Data Security and Storage</h3>
    <p><strong>Security.</strong> We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect personal data against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure or use. We ensure that all storage and processing environments are configured to align with the principles of the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including data minimization, integrity, confidentiality, and accountability.</p>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Certain applications, web platform, and operational data is stored and processed using AWS infrastructure.</li>
      <li>AWS data centers are located in the United States or other adequate jurisdictions, depending on operational needs.</li>

    </ul>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h3 class="text-neutral-11">7. Third Party Sites and Features</h3>
    <p>Our Online Services may contain links to, or integrations with, other websites, platforms, or services (such as social media platforms) that Quint does not operate or control.  These services and third-party features operate independently from us.  This Policy does not apply to those third parties.  The privacy practices of the relevant third parties, including details on the information they may collect about you, are subject to the privacy statements of these third parties, which we strongly suggest you review.  We are not responsible for the information practices, security or privacy practices of these third parties.</p>
    
    
    <hr>
    
    <h3 class="text-neutral-11">8. Children and Parents</h3>
    <p>Our Online Services are not directed at children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16.  For certain activities in which children are allowed to participate (for example, youth clinics, camps, kids clubs, and community outreach events), any request for personal data (such as registration data) is intended for and directed to the parent or legal guardian.</p>
    <p>In accordance with Article 8 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), where processing is based on consent and offered directly to a child, the consent must be given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility when the child is under the age applicable in their member state (typically between 13 and 16 years old).</p>
    <p>If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without proper consent, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.</p>
    <p>If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us without parental consent, please contact us using any of the methods described in the How to Contact Us section to request that we delete the personal data.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h3 class="text-neutral-11">9. Retention of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>To the extent required by applicable law, we retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide our products and services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other business purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements.  Because these factors vary for different types of personal data, actual retention periods may vary.  The criteria we use to determine the appropriate retention periods take into account how long the personal data is needed to provide our products and services, the applicable statute of limitations and records retention requirements under applicable law.</p>
    <p>Once personal data is no longer required, it is securely deleted from active systems; archived data is reviewed and scheduled for deletion and backups are encrypted and retained in accordance with our Data Retention Policy.</p>
